I am a third-year PhD student at University of Alberta, and supervised by Prof. [Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/). Before this, I received my bachelor and master's degrees at University of Alberta.

My research interests include NLP and ML. Specifically, I am interested in the interpretation of representations that can be understood by either machine learning models or human. I am also interested in the communication and interaction between different large language models.

### Less about me
I am an outdoor enthusiast. I like snowboarding and skiing in winter, and mountain biking and hiking in summer.

When I am staying at home. I enjoy sci-fi movie and hip-hop music.
