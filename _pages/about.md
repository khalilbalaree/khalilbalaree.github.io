I am a second-year PhD student at University of Alberta, and supervised by Prof. [Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/). Before this, I received my bachelor and master's degrees at University of Alberta.

My research interest includes NLP and ML. I am interested in the explainablility of the representations that can be understood by either machine learning models or human. I am also interested in the communication and interaction between different large language models.

### About Me

When I am staying at home. I enjoy Sci-fi Movie and Hiphop music.
