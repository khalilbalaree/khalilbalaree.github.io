## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Alberta, supervised by Prof. [Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/). I received both my BSc and MSc in Computing Science from the University of Alberta.

My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on:
- Interpretable representations that bridge machine learning models and human understanding
- Embedding learning for large language models
- Multi-agent communication and interaction among large language models

## Beyond Research

I am an outdoor enthusiast who loves snowboarding and skiing in winter, and mountain biking and hiking in summer. When staying indoors, I enjoy sci-fi movies and hip-hop music. I also have a British Shorthair cat named UA (short for University of Alberta).
