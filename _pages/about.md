## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Alberta, supervised by Prof. [Lili Mou](https://lili-mou.github.io/). I received both my bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Alberta.

My research interests lie in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. Specifically, I focus on:
- The interpretation of representations understandable by both machine learning models and humans
- Communication and interaction between different large language models
